`actions-in-recoder` was designed by learning from Redux but heavily influenced by functional languages. Like Redux, pure function important here to make things reloadable and reusabe. Also to be sure we use single app state here.

Let's just face the problem we have here. JavaScript is mutable, JavaScript AST contains quite statements, JavaScript is regarded as an in-browser assembly.
